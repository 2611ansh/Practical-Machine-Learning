we will deploy a real machine-learning model, and check what doing so feels like. More concretely, you will deploy a computer vision model trained to detect common objects in pictures. Deploying a model is one of the last steps in a prototypical machine-learning lifecycle. In this article, we will use a pre-trained model called YOLOV3. This model is very convenient for two reasons: it runs really fast, and for object detection, it yields accurate results.
